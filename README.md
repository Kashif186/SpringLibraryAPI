#Spring Library Project

The overall objective of the project is the following:
To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules.

This Spring Boot API uses:
* An application back-end developed using Java
* A managed MySQL database hosted locally
* Postman to make API calls which can be checked in Workbench


I expect the challenge to go well as the MVP was covered in our training so I had a good idea of what needed to be done before starting.

Setting up the classes such as domain, repo, services and controller went really well. I had no issues here. However, I ran into a lot of issues with testing and received a lot of bugs. I had to research these and see what I was doing wrong but managed to solve them all in the end.

Testing will be a lot easier in the future as I have become familiar with the bugs that I encountered. I could add more tables to my project and expand the usage of the application as a whole. Also, I could learn about implementing a front end and linking it to my project.
